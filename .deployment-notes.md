# Deployment Notes for Shared Hosting

## SQLite3 Configuration

The `sqlite3` package has been moved to **optionalDependencies** to support deployment on shared hosting environments that lack native build tools (python, make, g++).

### What This Means:

1. **Production Environment (Shared Hosting)**:
   - Uses **PostgreSQL** as the database (configured in `config.js`)
   - If `sqlite3` installation fails during `npm install`, it will be **skipped with a warning**
   - Application will work normally since PostgreSQL is used

2. **Development Environment**:
   - Can use either PostgreSQL or SQLite
   - If build tools are available, `sqlite3` will be installed
   - If build tools are missing, it will be skipped

3. **Testing**:
   - Configured to use SQLite by default in `config/database.js`
   - If `sqlite3` is not available, tests may need adjustment

### On Shared Hosting:

When deploying to shared hosting, you may see this warning during `npm install`:
```
npm WARN optional SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: sqlite3@^5.1.7
```

**This is normal and expected!** Your application will work fine using PostgreSQL.

### Environment Variables:

Make sure these are set on your shared hosting:
```env
DB_DIALECT=postgres
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=dsinfra
DB_USER=dsuser
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### If SQLite is Required:

If you absolutely need SQLite on shared hosting, contact your hosting provider to:
1. Install build tools (`python3`, `make`, `g++`)
2. Or use a pre-compiled SQLite binary package like `better-sqlite3`
